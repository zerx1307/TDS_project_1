DATA SCRAPING: The data was scraped from user on GITHUB API in berlin with user having over 200 follower. Firstly, we got user in Berlin, then the user details as mentioned , and finally for each user, up to 500 of their most recent repositories were retrieved. Then we retrieved the required data anad saved the csv files using pandas.

INTRESTING FACT: After, the work was done, I realised that in Berlin , among the user with ver 200 follower, python still stands strong and is the most popular language. Most of the user used javascript and python.

SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS: Developers should invest time into making the README.md concise, and clear , so that it increase engagement, visibity and the deveopers should make more and more open source projects as a contribution to the community of coders/programmer , and it'll also increase there followers.
